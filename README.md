# MyWeatherApp

# Overview

Your app should let the user input a zipcode, then see the 7-day forecast.  Selecting a forecast should display more information about the weather for that day, along with a random image of the city matching the zip code.  The user can favorite the image, then view a list of all of their favorited images.
